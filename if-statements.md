In programming languages, an "if" statement is a conditional statement that allows you to execute a block of code based on a certain condition. It is used to make decisions and control the flow of the program.

The basic syntax of an "if" statement typically consists of the keyword "if" followed by a condition in parentheses, and then a block of code enclosed in curly braces. 


**javaScript:**

\```javascript
let number = 10;

if (number > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive.");
}

```


**Dart:**

```dart
bool isRaining = true;

if (isRaining) {
    print("Take an umbrella with you!");
}

```

**Php:**

```php
$number = 10;

if ($number > 5) {
    echo "The number is greater than 5.";
}

```

**Java:**

```java
int number = 10;

if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive.");
}

```

**C++:**

```c++
int number = 10;

if (number > 0) {
    std::cout << "The number is positive." << std::endl;
}


```


**Objective-c:**

```objective-c
int number = 10;

if (number > 5) {
    NSLog(@"The number is greater than 5.");
}


```

**Swift:**

```swift
let number = 10

if number > 0 {
    print("The number is positive")
}

```

**Kotlin:**

```kotlin
val number = 10

  if (number > 0) {
        println("The number is positive.")
}

```

**Python:**

```python
x = 5

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive.")

```

**Go:**

```go
age := 20

if age >= 18 {
    fmt.Println("You are an adult.")
}

```

**Rust:**

```rust
let number = 5;

if number > 0 {
    println!("The number is positive.");
}

```


**C#:**

```c#
int number = 10;

if (number > 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The number is positive.");
}

```

**Ruby:**

```ruby
number = 10

if number > 0
  puts "The number is positive."
end

```









Note that the specific syntax and keywords may vary slightly depending on the programming language you're using, but the general concept of an "if" statement remains the same.
