The "if-else" statement is a fundamental construct in programming that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on a certain condition. It provides a way to define alternative paths for your program's execution.



**javaScript:**

```javascript
let number = 10;

if (number > 0) {
  console.log("The number is positive.");
} else {
  console.log("The number is not positive.");
}


```


**Dart:**

```dart
int number = 5;

if (number > 0) {
    print('The number is positive.');
} else {
    print('The number is zero or negative.');
}

```

**Php:**

```php
$number = 10;

if ($number > 0) {
    echo "The number is positive.";
} else {
    echo "The number is not positive.";
}

```

**Java:**

```java
int number = 5;

if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive.");
    } else {
    System.out.println("The number is non-positive.");
}

```

**C++:**

```c++
int number = 10;

if (number > 0) {
    std::cout << "The number is positive." << std::endl;
    }
    else {
    std::cout << "The number is not positive." << std::endl;
}

```


**Objective-c:**

```objective-c
int number = 5;

if (number > 0) {
    NSLog(@"The number is positive.");
} else {
    NSLog(@"The number is non-positive.");
}


```

**Swift:**

```swift
let number = 10

if number > 0 {
    print("The number is positive.")
} else {
    print("The number is not positive.")
}

```

**Kotlin:**

```kotlin
val number = 10

if (number > 0) {
    println("Number is positive.")
    } else {
    println("Number is zero or negative.")
}

```

**Python:**

```python
x = 5

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")


```

**Go:**

```go
 number := 10

if number > 0 {
    fmt.Println("Number is positive")
} else {
        fmt.Println("Number is non-positive")
}

```

**Rust:**

```rust
let number = 10;

if number > 5 {
    println!("The number is greater than 5");
} else {
    println!("The number is not greater than 5");
}

```


**C#:**

```c#
int number = 10;

if (number > 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Number is positive");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Number is non-positive");
}

```

**Ruby:**

```ruby
x = 10

if x > 5
  puts "x is greater than 5"
else
  puts "x is not greater than 5"
end


```



Note that the specific syntax and keywords may vary slightly depending on the programming language you're using, but the general concept of an "if else" statement remains the same.
